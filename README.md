# Traffic-Monitoring-in-Bangaladesh

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic monitoring system for Bangladesh using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system will analyze real-time traffic conditions, detect congestion, and identify rule violations to enhance road safety and efficiency.

## Features
Real-time Traffic Analysis: Uses live video feeds to monitor traffic conditions.
Vehicle Detection & Classification: Identifies and categorizes vehicles on the road.
Traffic Congestion Detection: Measures traffic density and flow to detect congestion.
Violation Detection: Identifies rule-breaking activities such as signal violations and lane changes.
Data Visualization: Displays traffic insights using interactive dashboards.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLO
Web Technologies: Flask, Streamlit for dashboard visualization
Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for storing traffic data)
